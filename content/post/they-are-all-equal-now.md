*Barry Lyndon* is a magnificent work, not only for its exceptional employment
of cameras, lightning and score, but more importantly for Kubrick's subtilty
and ability to fantastically enhance Thackeray's already layered plot.

As customary with Kubrick (if it is customary with Thackeray I cannot say, for
I shamefully admit to not having read him yet), there are many ways to
interpret the plot, which is of course his intention. It's a simultaneous
celebration of and condemnation of *lost Europe*. As the 18th century nears its
end, the corruption and muliebrity of the ruling class is palpable. In this we
find a simultaneous tragedy and impetus towards the coming cataclysm. 

Yet the entire film is also a magnificent demonstration of exactly why the
ascension of the third estate is a catastrophe. If it was ever avoidable,
however, and if it would have really been for the better remains an open
question -- one held open especially by brilliant minds like Kubrick and
Thackeray. What Barry has of the heroic spirit and virility that the
aristocracy has lost, he lacks in refinement, taste but especially
*discrimination*, the most essential of aristocratic traits. 

Just like the aristocracy spoils itself to its own doom at the end of the 18th
century, and just like the third estate today spoils the entire world into even
worse misguided disaster, Barry spoils his own child to death through excessive
leniency. Seeing is only half the act.

It would be easy to say that the film becomes a tragedy during the second act,
but that would be naïve. It is of course a tragedy from the start. A tragedy
that goes much beyond the film.
