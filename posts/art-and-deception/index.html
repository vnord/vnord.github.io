<h1>Art and Deception</h1>
Sep. 5, 2015
<br><br>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I did think it looked a bit rushed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash; <em>Dr. Katja Schneider, Director of the State Art Museum of Moritzburg in
Saxony-Anhalt, after being informed that the painting that she had identified
as the work of Guggenheim Prize winning artist Ernst Wilhelm Nay was in fact
the work of a chimpanzee.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In his seminal work <em>De la démocratie en Amérique</em>, Alexis de Tocqueville
correctly predicts the development that art would take under the influence of
the democratic spirit. It would be reduced to shapes and colours and similar
fundamental and simplistic constructs, so as to enable demotic access. The
lower man, lacking both the erudition required to identify the motives and
symbolisms of the great art of the past, and the good taste required to
differentiate beautiful works of skilled artists from ugly ones by unskilled
artists, is most satisfied when these to him embarrassing elements are
expunged. And it is to the lower man that democracy pays homage, in fact it is
the axis around which it revolves.</p>
<p>It may be considered somewhat strange, but not surprising, then, that
contemporary &ldquo;higher&rdquo; society elevates this obviously inane &ldquo;art&rdquo; not for its
merits of lacking quality, but ostentatiously for the very opposite merits &ndash;
it is purported that the so-called &ldquo;art&rdquo; is in fact of the highest quality, but
that this fact is concealed to the ignorant eyes of the common plebe (and the
revelation that these contemporary &ldquo;<em>connoisseurs</em>&rdquo; are in fact the most
plebeian of all is obviously not welcomed). The most remarkable thing of all,
though, is that the deception, much like in the famous <em>Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes</em>
parable, is called out by very few. Not only is contemporary man of the lower
sort which enjoys works of anti-art, but he even lacks the ability to
comprehend it or, if he has comprehended it, admit it.</p>
