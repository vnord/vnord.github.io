<p>The following quote is so good that no commentary can improve upon it. The
full interview from which it is taken is of course a very worthwhile read, even
though this is the highlight. <a href=http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/1/i_moglen_1.php>You can do so over at Cabinet
Magazine</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1979, when I was working at IBM, I wrote an internal memo lambasting the
Apple Lisa, which
was Apple&rsquo;s first attempt to adapt Xerox PARC technology, the graphical user
interface, into a desktop PC. I was then working on the development of APL2, a
nested array, algorithmic, symbolic language, and I was committed to the idea
that what we were doing with computers was making languages that were better
than natural languages for procedural thought. The idea was to do for whole
ranges of human thinking what mathematics has been doing for thousands of years
in the quantitative arrangement of knowledge, and to help people think in more
precise and clear ways. What I saw in the Xerox PARC technology was the caveman
interface, you point and you grunt. A massive winding down, regressing away
from language, in order to address the technological nervousness of the user.
Users wanted to be infantilized, to return to a pre-linguistic condition in the
using of computers, and the Xerox PARC technology&rsquo;s primary advantage was that
it allowed users to address computers in a pre-linguistic way.</p>
