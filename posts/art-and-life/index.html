<h1>Art and Life</h1>
Aug. 17, 2015

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Si en un incendio tuviera que escoger entre salvar a un gato o un
Rembrandt, salvaría al gato,…y luego lo dejaría libre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash; <em>Alberto Giacometti</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above citation, in itself, could be significant, had it been uttered by
someone else, perhaps a true artist. But Giacometti was not an artist, he was
as prime a representative of the post-modern hacks that have proliferated our
poor museums with heaps of trash for a good while now as any. Had, however,
Giacometti been a real artist, the statement could have been one of
differentiation between sterile representation and true spirit. Giacometti,
though, was as we have already concluded not a real artist, and one must assume
that the lifelessness that he saw within the works of Rembrandt must have been
a reflection of the sterility and lackluster quality of his own works.</p>
<p>The situation becomes even more amusing when the protagonist of Lelouch&rsquo;s <em>Un
Homme et une Femme</em> misquotes Giacometti and implies that the distinction was
between &ldquo;life and art&rdquo;, and that Giacometti &ldquo;chose life&rdquo;. This one among many
other trite moments in the film does however starkly illustrate the mind of the
contemporary (<em>gauche caviar</em>) man. Art and life are viewed as strongly
differentiated concepts, belonging to different ontological classes, almost
alien to each other. We know, however, that such a differentiation is
meaningless, and that all perceived reality is representation. Art and life
are, on a higher level beyond linguistics, pointless distinctions. The cat is
of course an archetype, and not a real, existing animal. The statement does not
guide an act nor inspire any elevated values except a heightened antagonism
towards true art and beauty. It is represented as sterile and inferior (which
it of course is in the case of such hacks as Giacometti and his kin) when
compared to living creatures of the flesh. Art is <em>ipso facto</em> reduced to mere
representation, formal metaphor and abstract object. This is the mode of
thinking that contemporary western society has been immersed in for a much too
long while now, and it seems evident that it shall soon have to break its back
under its own weight, if it has not already done so.</p>
